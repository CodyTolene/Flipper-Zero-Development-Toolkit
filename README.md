  <p align="center">
    Hey there, fellow developer!
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    Introducing the Flipper Zero application development starter kit! üéâ It's the ultimate tool to kickstart your creative journey with Flipper Zero projects.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    Guess what? I've made it super easy to use! No more headaches from complicated setups. Just fire it up on Windows, Python, and good ol' Visual Studio Code, and you're ready to roll! My goal is to save you time and frustration, so I've put together a friendly readme that you can easily fork and use for your own projects. No need to reinvent the wheel, I've got your back!

## Software Installation <a name="software-installation"></a>

**Add how to install the software and/or links to your app store page in this section.**

Included in this repository is a convenient GitHub Action workflow that automatically lints and compiles the FAP files for both development and release firmware builds. This workflow streamlines the process and ensures your app is ready to go.

Manual Installation Option:

For those whose app isn't yet available on the [Flipper Application Catalog](#flipper-application-catalog), worry not! We've got you covered with a user-friendly manual installation option. Simply follow these steps:

1. Access the latest Action run here: https://github.com/CodyTolene/Flipper-Zero-Development-Toolkit/actions

2. Locate the compiled FAP files in a zip format.

3. Install on your flipper device by USB.

## Development Guide <a name="development-guide"></a>

1. Make sure you have [Git][link-git] and [Visual Studio Code][link-visual-studio-code] installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository and its submodule dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodyTolene/Flipper-Zero-Development-Toolkit.git --recurse-submodules
   ```
3. Download and install [Python][link-python].
4. Open a new terminal in the "src-fap" directory of this project.
5. Run `py -m pip install --upgrade ufbt` to ensure you have the latest [uFBT][link-ufbt] installed.
6. Run `ufbt vscode_dist` to download the Windows toolchain and set up Visual Studio Code files.
7. Open the project "fap" directory ("src-fap") in Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have "Microsoft C/C++" extension installed and enabled.
8. In Visual Studio Code, open the command palette (CTRL+SHIFT+P) and type "C/C++ Edit Configurations (UI)" to find and open its settings. Add the following directory to the "Include path" option:
   ```
   ${workspaceFolder}/../.submodules/flipperzero-firmware
   ```
   This includes the Flipper Zero firmware library for your project (you can update it to a custom firmware if needed).
9. If Visual Studio Code shows import errors after saving the above settings from step 8, run the build script (see step 10) to resolve them.
10. You can now perform various tasks within Visual Studio Code using Ctrl+Shift+B or "Terminal -> Run Task." Alternatively, you can use [uFBT][link-ufbt] scripts in the terminal. Here are some useful commands to get started:
    | Command | Description |
    | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | `ufbt cli` | Starts a CLI session with the Flipper Zero device. |
    | `ufbt build` | Build the application. |
    | `ufbt lint` | Lint the application. |
    | `ufbt format` | Format the application. |
    | `ufbt launch` | Upload and start application over USB. |
11. After making changes, linting, testing, etc., please refer to the [contributions section](#contributions) for a guide on how to submit your code for review.

## Flipper Application Catalog <a name="flipper-application-catalog"></a>

Use the following flow to verify build requirements for the [Flipper Application Catalog][link-flipper-application-catalog]:

1. Open a new terminal at the root of this project.
2. Run `py -m venv venv` to install a [virtual environment][link-python-venv] for use.
3. Activate the virtual environment with the command `venv\Scripts\activate`.
4. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r .submodules/flipper-application-catalog/tools/requirements.txt`.
5. Ensure that "src-fap\manifest.yml" has the latest commit sha that will be used for submission. Also, verify that the version is correct.
6. Run `py .submodules/flipper-application-catalog/tools/bundle.py src-fap/manifest.yml bundle.zip` to verify and bundle the application.
7. If the above command succeeds, the application is ready for submission. Otherwise, fix any errors and try again.
8. Use `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment and return to your normal terminal.
